Hello My Name is Patrick Ledoit

My game is called Wallz

It is coded in Python so Python needs to be downloaded
It uses pygame so it also has to be downloaded

Make sure that all the folders and files are in one folder (let's call it Game)
Within this "Game" folder you should have: "assets" folder, "sounds" folder, "wallz.py", and "Read Me.txt". 
Open cmd or terminal
Redirect to the "Game" folder
